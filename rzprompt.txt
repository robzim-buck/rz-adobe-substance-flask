A wooden cutting board on a rustic outdoor table with several tacos placed on it. The tacos are filled with shredded meat, avocado slices, and topped with onion rings, with lime wedges scattered around the board. In the background, there is a red cloth napkin and a wooden crate holding glass bottles of Coca-Cola. One Coca-Cola bottle is placed on the table with the cap off, and the sunlit greenery can be seen in the background. The scene feels inviting and summer-like, with a nostalgic and casual picnic vibe.
